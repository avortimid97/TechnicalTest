# TechnicalTest

This is the solution to the 3 problems you have asked me to solve. 
There are 3 classes for the problem, 1 main class to run them from, as well as 3 classes for the tests, with a TestRunner class to run them and see the results.

The project should be imported to an IDE and be ran locally.
I used Eclipse and had packages but when committing the files, they disappeared. You may see the imports on the top of each file.
